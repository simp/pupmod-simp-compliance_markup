    title: Access Control Policy And Procedures
    description: |
      The organization develops, disseminates, and reviews/updates [Assignment: organizationdefined
      frequency]:
      a. A formal, documented access control policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles,
      responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and
      compliance; and
      b. Formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the access control policy
      and associated access controls.

      Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the
      effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the AC family.
      Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations,
      policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization
      level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can
      be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations. The procedures
      can be established for the security program in general and for particular information systems, if
      needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and
      procedures. Related control: PM-9.

      Control Enhancements: None.

      References: NIST Special Publications 800-12, 800-100.
    notes: Implementation specific. Though listed in the Technical class, policy and
      procedural controls are established at the organizational level which drives
      technical implementation. SIMP can technically implement this control.
