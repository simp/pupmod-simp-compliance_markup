## Classes

### compliance_markup

This class should be included *after* all other classes in your site so that
the mapper can properly analyze the standing catalog.

#### Parameters

The following parameters are available in the `compliance_markup` class.

##### `compliance_map`

Data type: `Hash`

The compliance Hash to which to map

* This defaults to *Data In Modules*

##### `validate_profiles`

Data type: `Optional[Array[String[1]]]`

Compliance profiles that you wish to validate against

Default value: `undef`

##### `report_types`

Data type: `Array[
    Enum[
      'full',
      'non_compliant',
      'compliant',
      'unknown_resources',
      'unknown_parameters',
      'custom_entries'
    ]
  ]`

The types of entries that you want to report on

* full               => Include all report types*
* non_compliant      => Report on non-compliant parameters*
* unknown_parameters => Report on parameters that are mapped but not included in the catalog*
* custom_entries     => Report custom calls to compliance_markup::compliance_map() from the codebase
* compliant          => Report on compliant parameters
* unknown_resources  => Report on classes that are mapped but not included in the catalog

* This is ignored if ``options`` is specified

Default value: ['non_compliant', 'unknown_parameters', 'custom_entries']

##### `report_format`

Data type: `Enum['json','yaml']`

The output format for the report

Default value: 'json'

##### `report_on_client`

Data type: `Boolean`

Save a copy of the report on the client as a ``File`` resource

* This will make the report show up in PuppetDB but may also expose
  unwanted vulnerability information

Default value: `false`

##### `report_on_server`

Data type: `Boolean`

Save a copy of the report on the puppet server

Default value: `true`

##### `server_report_dir`

Data type: `Optional[Stdlib::Absolutepath]`

The path where the server should store reports

* If you change this, you must make sure that the puppet *server* can write
  to the location.
* By default, this is written to ``Puppet[:vardir]`` as the Puppet *server*
  sees it:
  ``/opt/puppetlabs/server/data/puppetserver/simp/compliance_reports``

Default value: `undef`

##### `custom_report_entries`

A hash that will be included in the compliance report under the heading
``site_data``

* This can be used for adding *anything* to the compliance report. The hash
  is simply processed with ``to_yaml``

##### `options`

Data type: `Optional[Hash]`

The options to pass directly to the `compliance_markup::compliance_map` validation function

* If specified, various other options may be ignored

Default value: `undef`

##### `custom_report_data`

Data type: `Optional[Hash]`



Default value: `undef`

## Defined types

### compliance_markup::map

phase of the catalog compile.

Defines appear to be run after all classes

The options hash is passed directly to the
`compliance_markup::compliance_map()` function

#### Parameters

The following parameters are available in the `compliance_markup::map` defined type.

##### `options`

Data type: `Any`



Default value: {}

## Functions

### compliance_map

Type: Ruby 3.x API

This function provides a mechanism for mapping compliance data to
settings in Puppet.

It should be used **once**, after all of your classes have been included
and is designed for use in classes to validate that parameters are
properly set.

The easiest method for doing this is to add it as the **last** line of
``site.pp``.

When called, the parameters of all classes will be evaluated against
global scope variables followed by data from lookup().

The variable space against which the class parameters will be evaluated
must be structured as the following hash:

  compliance_map :
    <compliance_profile> :
      <class_name>::<parameter> :
        'identifiers' :
          - 'ID String'
        'value'      : 'Compliant Value'

For instance, if you were mapping to NIST 800-53 in the SSH class, you
could use something like the following in Hiera:

  compliance_map :
    nist_800_53 :
      ssh::permit_root_login :
        'identifiers' :
          - 'CCE-1234'
        'value'      : false

'value' items have some special properties. Hashes and Arrays will
be matched using '==' in Ruby.

Everything else will be converted to a String and can be provided a Ruby
regular expression of the following format: 're:REGEX' where 'REGEX' does
**not** include the starting and trailing slashes.

  Example:
    'value' : 're:oo'

    Matches: 'foo' and 'boo' but not 'bar'

You may also add compliance data directly to your modules outside of a
parameter mapping. This is useful if you have more advanced logic that is
required to meet a particular internal requirement.

NOTE: The parser does not know what line number and, possibly, what file
the function is being called from based on the version of the Puppet
parser being used.

## Global Options

If a Hash is passed as the only argument, then this will configure the
global report settings.

The following options are supported:

  **:report_types**

  Default: [ 'non_compliant', 'unknown_parameters', 'custom_entries' ]

  A String, or Array that denotes which types of reports should be
  generated.

  Valid Types:
    **full**               => The full report, with all other types
                              included.
    **non_compliant**      => Items that differ from the reference
                              will be reported.
    **compliant**          => Compliant items will be reported.
    **unknown_resources**  => Reference resources without a
                              system value will be reported.
    **unknown_parameters** => Reference parameters without a system
                              value will be reported.
    **custom_entries**     => Any one-off custom calls to
                              compliance_map will be reported.

  **:site_data**

  Default: None

  A valid *Hash* that will be converted *as passed* and emitted
  into your node compliance report.

  This can be used to add site-specific or other information to the
  report that may be useful for post-processing.

  **:format**

  Default: 'json'

  A String that indicates what output style to use. Valid values are
  'json' and 'yaml'.

  **:client_report**

    Default: false

    A Boolean which, if set, will place a copy of the report on the
    client itself. This will ensure that PuppetDB will have a copy of the
    report for later processing.

  **:server_report**

    Default: true

    A Boolean which, if set, will store a copy of the
    report on the Server.

  **:server_report_dir**

    Default: Puppet[:vardir]/simp/compliance_reports

    An Absolute Path that specifies the location on
    the *server* where the reports should be stored.

    A directory will be created for each FQDN that
    has a report.

 **:default_map**

    Default: None

    The default map that should be used if no others can be found. This
    will probably never be manually set during normal usage via the
    compliance_markup module

  **:catalog_to_compliance_map**

    Default: false

    A Boolean which, if set, will dump a compatible compliance_map of
    *all* resources and defines that are in the current catalog.

    This will be written to ``server_report_dir`` prefaced by the unique catalog ID.

    NOTE: This is an experimental feature and subject to change without notice

Example:
  # Only non-compilant entries and only store them on the client and the
  # server
  compliance_map({
    :report_types  => [
      'non_compliant',
      'unknown_parameters',
      'custom_entries'
    ],
    :client_report => true,
    :server_report => true
  })

## Custom Content

The following optional **ordered** parameters may be used to add your own
compliance data at any location:

  :compliance_profile => 'A String, or Array, that denotes the compliance
                          profile(s) to which you are mapping.'
  :identifier         => 'A unique identifier String or Array for the
                          policy to which you are mapping.'
  :notes              => 'An *optional* String that allows for arbitrary
                          notes to include in the compliance report'

Example:
  if $circumstance {
    compliance_map('nist_800_53','CCE-1234','Note about this section')
    ...code that applies CCE-1234...
  }

#### `compliance_map()`

This function provides a mechanism for mapping compliance data to
settings in Puppet.

It should be used **once**, after all of your classes have been included
and is designed for use in classes to validate that parameters are
properly set.

The easiest method for doing this is to add it as the **last** line of
``site.pp``.

When called, the parameters of all classes will be evaluated against
global scope variables followed by data from lookup().

The variable space against which the class parameters will be evaluated
must be structured as the following hash:

  compliance_map :
    <compliance_profile> :
      <class_name>::<parameter> :
        'identifiers' :
          - 'ID String'
        'value'      : 'Compliant Value'

For instance, if you were mapping to NIST 800-53 in the SSH class, you
could use something like the following in Hiera:

  compliance_map :
    nist_800_53 :
      ssh::permit_root_login :
        'identifiers' :
          - 'CCE-1234'
        'value'      : false

'value' items have some special properties. Hashes and Arrays will
be matched using '==' in Ruby.

Everything else will be converted to a String and can be provided a Ruby
regular expression of the following format: 're:REGEX' where 'REGEX' does
**not** include the starting and trailing slashes.

  Example:
    'value' : 're:oo'

    Matches: 'foo' and 'boo' but not 'bar'

You may also add compliance data directly to your modules outside of a
parameter mapping. This is useful if you have more advanced logic that is
required to meet a particular internal requirement.

the function is being called from based on the version of the Puppet

    **unknown_resources**  => Reference resources without a
                              system value will be reported.
    **unknown_parameters** => Reference parameters without a system
                              value will be reported.
